# Finetuning-BERT-on-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
In this code we finetune BERT using BilSTM on Movie reviews sentiment analysis classifcation, and finding overall polarity from BERT-BilSTM output vector
The code uses IMDb dataset. For other datasets check Utilities.py.
The code is in tensorflow 
Training and testing are done in the safe file BERT+BiLSTM-SA.py
Just run BERT+BiLSTM-SA.py
